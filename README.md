# RuVector Catalog v3.5.0

**The architect's playbook for RuVector — because a 1.58M-line monorepo is too deep for anyone to search alone.**

   embeddings. Delete embeddings.json and the API key."

## The Problem This Solves

RuVector is a monorepo with **113 Rust crates, 56 npm packages, 30 WASM builds, and 200+ technologies**. It has everything from vector search to quantum simulation to spiking neural networks. But that richness creates a discovery problem:

```
THE DISCOVERY PROBLEM

Without catalog:                  With catalog:
├── npm docs → no CNN export      ├── Catalog: ruvector-cnn exists
├── "not available" ← WRONG       ├── Build from submodule (90s)
└── Uses OpenAI Vision ← $$$      └── 512D MobileNet embeddings ← FREE
```

</details>

**The catalog exists because the monorepo is too large for any AI agent or developer to search effectively.** Without it, agents default to "not available" when features exist but aren't in the obvious place (npm). The catalog maps every capability to its access path.

## What It Does (Three Layers)

![Three Layers](assets/diagrams/three-layers.svg)

<details>
<summary>ASCII Version (for AI/accessibility)</summary>

```
LAYER 1: RECOMMEND — "I need X" → Here's the component
LAYER 2: MIGRATE  — "You're using aging tech" → Replace + DELETE
LAYER 3: ACCESS   — "How?" → npm / WASM build / NAPI
```

</details>

---

## How It Works

![Access Paths](assets/diagrams/access-paths.svg)

<details>
<summary>ASCII Version (for AI/accessibility)</summary>

```
PATH 1: npm (instant)     PATH 2: WASM (90s)      PATH 3: NAPI (fast)
require('ruvector')       wasm-pack build          @ruvector/*-node
170 exports               30 crates                Pre-built binaries

DECISION TREE:
├── In require('ruvector')?        → USE IT
├── In @ruvector/<name> npm?       → USE IT
├── In ruvector/crates/*-wasm/?    → BUILD IT
├── In ruvector/crates/<name>/?    → BUILD NAPI
└── None of above?                 → DOESN'T EXIST
```

## Migration Intelligence

The catalog detects 10 aging technology patterns and provides complete replacement guides:

<details>
<summary>ASCII Version (for AI/accessibility)</summary>

```
DETECT                   → REPLACE              → DELETE
OPENAI_API_KEY           → AdaptiveEmbedder     → API keys
embeddings.json          → RvfDatabase          → JSON files
pinecone.init()          → VectorDb + RVF       → Cloud SDK
O(n) cosine loop         → HNSW O(log n)        → Loop code
No image search          → ruvector-cnn-wasm    → (add)
Custom RRF               → differentiableSearch → RRF code
No doc relationships     → buildGraph()         → (add)
Manual anomaly checks    → CoherenceMonitor     → (add)
Basic attention          → FlashAttention-3     → Old attn
No verification          → ruvector-verified    → (add)

Steps 5-11 of the 15-step sunset checklist are where migrations FAIL.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Bun

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### 2. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mamd69/ruvector-catalog.git
cd ruvector-catalog
bun install
```

### 3. Add the RuVector source (for catalog rebuilds)

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector.git ruvector
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 4. Ask your first question

In Claude Code:

> use @ruvector-catalog to find technologies for searching documents by meaning

Or via CLI:

```bash
bun src/cli.ts search "search documents by meaning, not keywords"
```

---

## How to Use

### Ask Claude (Recommended)

**Quick search:**
> use @ruvector-catalog to find technologies for detecting errors in AI output

**Migration analysis:**
> use @ruvector-catalog to analyze my codebase for aging patterns and recommend RuVector replacements

**Full proposal (RVBP):**
> use @ruvector-catalog to create an RVBP for building real-time patient monitoring

### Command Line

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bun src/cli.ts search "query"` | Search for matching technologies |
| `bun src/cli.ts rvbp "problem"` | Generate implementation proposal |
| `bun src/cli.ts list` | Show all 200+ technologies |
| `bun src/cli.ts stats` | Show catalog statistics |
| `bun src/cli.ts verify` | Check if catalog is up to date |

### Deep Analysis (Swarm)

> use @ruvector-catalog to deeply analyze how to build a real-time patient monitoring system and create an RVBP in docs/research/

Multiple AI agents work in parallel for 30-60 seconds, producing architecture-level guidance.

---

## Migration Examples

### Before: OpenAI Embeddings ($0.002/query)

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({ model: 'text-embedding-3-small', input: text })
});
```

### After: RuVector AdaptiveEmbedder (local, free, learns)

```javascript
const { AdaptiveEmbedder } = require('ruvector');
const embedder = new AdaptiveEmbedder({ loraRank: 4, contrastiveLearning: true });
await embedder.init();
const embedding = await embedder.embed(text);
```

### Before: JSON Index with O(n) Search

```javascript
const index = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('embeddings.json'));
const results = index.map(e => ({ score: cosine(query, e.vec), ...e }))
  .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score).slice(0, 10);
```

### After: RVF Binary with O(log n) HNSW

```javascript
const { RvfDatabase } = require('@ruvector/rvf');
const db = await RvfDatabase.openReadonly('index.rvf');
const results = await db.query(queryVector, 10);
```

## What RuVector Catalog Does NOT Do

- **Not a content generator.** It recommends *infrastructure* technologies, not blog posts.
- **Not an app builder.** It recommends components, not complete applications.
- **Not a chatbot.** It answers one question: "What technologies should I use?"
- **Not a deployment tool.** It tells you what to build and migrate from, not how to deploy.

**What it IS:** The expert architect that maps your problem to the right RuVector capabilities and ensures you complete the full migration — including deleting what you replaced.

---

## File Structure

| File or Folder | What it contains |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | The architect's playbook (problem/solution map, migration intelligence, access paths) |
| `domains/` | Industry-specific guides (healthcare, finance, robotics, edge/IoT, genomics) |
| `src/` | Search engine and proposal generator source code |
| `tests/` | 168 tests validating search quality |
| `docs/` | Architecture decisions and domain design documents |
| `ruvector/` | The RuVector monorepo (git submodule, ~1.58M lines Rust) |

## Keeping It Updated

```bash
git submodule update --remote ruvector
bun scripts/build-catalog.ts
bun src/cli.ts verify
```
